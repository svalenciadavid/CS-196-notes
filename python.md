# Python
**Python** is a programming language, duh!
- **object oriented** & high level 
- converted into bytecode for an interpreter to execute.
- ends in .py

Object oriented: uses objects (ofc!)
Your code should be **pythonic** eg: it should be styled properly and less code whilst maintaing readability is the best.

### Making a simple hello world program
In your terminal, use the follwing syntax to create a python script 
```bash$
$  python <filename>.py
$  python3 <filename>.py
```
Either of these methods work.
