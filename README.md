# README

This is going to be a collection of the notes for CS 196, written in markdown for your viewing pleasure. Please understand that I am also a student with you guys, I write these during the lectures, but I know when I first post them they will look wack. So! I will be re-formatting them a few days after (hopefully expect maybe a day or two later) so that it has everything from the lecture :)
